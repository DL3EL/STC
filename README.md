OpenHAB Integration for STC heating controller
STC is a controller to enable old central heating systems for homeautomation by bavartec (https://www.bavartec.de/). Normal usage is via own APP. As the divice is easily configrable via HTTP commands, this is an integration into OpenHAB.
Just copy the files into the OpenHAB directories (items, things, etc)
stc-f.page holds a sample page, how to use it. This has to be copied manually into a gui created page.
